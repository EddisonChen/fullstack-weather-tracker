Full-Stack Weather Tracker

Upon city search in textbox, the application associates the city clicked on with a city ID, and fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
That current data is posted into the locally hosted database via a Node API, and fetched the next time that city is searched.

The technologies and frameworks involved in this project are React.js, Node.js, and MySQL.
